# Library-Managment-System-Using-Flask
This project implements a simple Flask-based REST API for managing a library system. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and members. Postman is used to test the API endpoints.

Features
CRUD operations for books:

Add a book
View all books
Get a specific book by its ID
Update a book
Delete a book
CRUD operations for members:

Add a member
View all members
Get a specific member by their ID
Update a member
Delete a member
Setup
Prerequisites
Install Python (v3.8 or above).
Install Postman for testing the API.
Running the Flask App on Google Colab
Clone or copy the code into Google Colab.
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
!pip install flask
!pip install pyngrok
Run the Flask app on Colab:
Use the provided code in Colab to run the server.
Note the Public URL generated by ngrok (e.g., http://<some-random-name>.ngrok.io).
Use the public URL to access the API.
Using Postman to Test the API
Base URL
Replace <public_url> with the ngrok-generated public URL (e.g., http://<some-random-name>.ngrok.io).
